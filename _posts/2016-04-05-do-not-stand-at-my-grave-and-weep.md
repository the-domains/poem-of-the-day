# Do not stand at my grave and weep

Do not stand at my grave and weep:  
I am not there; I do not sleep.  
I am a thousand winds that blow,  
I am the diamond glints on snow,  
I am the sun on ripened grain,  
I am the gentle autumn rain.  
When you awaken in the morning's hush  
I am the swift uplifting rush  
Of quiet birds in circling flight.  
I am the soft starshine at night.  
Do not stand at my grave and cry:  
I am not there; I did not die.

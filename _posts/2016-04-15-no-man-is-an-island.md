# No man is an island

## by John Donne
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/29e793ab-04e8-4dfe-9841-4b57e6f617ee.jpg)

No man is an island,  
Entire of itself;  
Every man is a piece of the continent,   
A part of the main.

If a clod be washed away by the sea,  
Europe is the less,  
As well as if a promontory were:  
As well as if a manor of thy friend's  
Or of thine own were.

Any man's death diminishes me,  
Because I am involved in mankind.  
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;  
It tolls for thee.

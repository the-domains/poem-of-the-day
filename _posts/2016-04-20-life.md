LIFE, believe, is not a dream  
So dark as sages say;  
Oft a little morning rain  
Foretells a pleasant day.  
Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,  
But these are transient all;  
If the shower will make the roses bloom,  
O why lament its fall ?

Rapidly, merrily,  
Life's sunny hours flit by,  
Gratefully, cheerily,  
Enjoy them as they fly !

What though Death at times steps in  
And calls our Best away ?  
What though sorrow seems to win,  
O'er hope, a heavy sway ?  
Yet hope again elastic springs,  
Unconquered, though she fell;  
Still buoyant are her golden wings,  
Still strong to bear us well.  
Manfully, fearlessly,  
The day of trial bear,  
For gloriously, victoriously,  
Can courage quell despair !

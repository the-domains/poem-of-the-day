# Life is fine

I went down to the river,  
I set down on the bank.  
I tried to think but couldn't,  
So I jumped in and sank.

I came up once and hollered!  
I came up twice and cried!  
If that water hadn't a-been so cold  
I might've sunk and died.

But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!

I took the elevator  
Sixteen floors above the ground.  
I thought about my baby  
And thought I would jump down.

I stood there and I hollered!  
I stood there and I cried!  
If it hadn't a-been so high  
I might've jumped and died.

But it was High up there! It was high!

So since I'm still here livin',  
I guess I will live on.  
I could've died for love--  
But for livin' I was born

Though you may hear me holler,  
And you may see me cry--  
I'll be dogged, sweet baby,  
If you gonna see me die.

Life is fine! Fine as wine! Life is fine!
